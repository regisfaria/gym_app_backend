# Workouty

## Overview  

This project is developed with **Elixir**, using the **Phoenix** framework. It was configured with **PostgreSQL** in a **Docker** container.

This is a **Backend API** in **GraphQL** to handle trainings.

Here you will be able to register trainings and exercises, linking a videoUrl into every exercise, along with a protocol description on how to execute it properly. All exercises are inside trainings, where you will be able to track time of your current training easily. 

## Installation & Running

To start your Phoenix server:

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

I've added a "insomniaRoutes.json" file in the project root, where you can import the main routes into your Insomnia.
